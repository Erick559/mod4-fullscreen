00:01.080 --> 00:03.849
Good morning everyone and thank you for coming today.

00:03.850 --> 00:06.193
We are here to discuss the situation of the

00:06.194 --> 00:10.121
displaced widows and female heads of households and how

00:10.122 --> 00:12.889
we can advocate for their rights to return to

00:12.890 --> 00:15.825
their properties when they return to their villages.

00:15.826 --> 00:18.929
First, I think it is important that we

00:18.930 --> 00:22.073
include women in the decision making process.

00:22.074 --> 00:25.233
This is a women's rights issue and it

00:25.234 --> 00:27.649
is crucial that their voices are heard.

00:27.650 --> 00:30.311
I agree, but we have to keep in mind

00:30.312 --> 00:33.615
the mentality of some of the traditional leaders.

00:33.616 --> 00:36.471
The idea of giving decision power or

00:36.472 --> 00:39.303
voice to women is new to them.

00:39.304 --> 00:41.175
How can we create a safe

00:41.176 --> 00:43.831
space for women to speak freely?

00:43.832 --> 00:46.655
Many of the widows may be hesitant to speak

00:46.656 --> 00:50.487
up because of fear of retaliation or stigma.

00:50.488 --> 00:53.287
Maybe to strengthen their voices, we could pair

00:53.288 --> 00:56.743
them with each other or if appropriate, with

00:56.744 --> 00:59.615
a male relative who supports their rights.

00:59.616 --> 01:01.399
This will give them the support and

01:01.400 --> 01:03.623
confidence they need to speak up.

01:03.624 --> 01:05.175
Good point.

01:05.176 --> 01:07.663
We also need to bring attention to the national

01:07.664 --> 01:11.575
laws that mandate equal rights for women and remind

01:11.576 --> 01:15.175
the traditional leaders they must respect the constitution.

01:15.176 --> 01:16.631
Now, that is true.

01:16.632 --> 01:20.671
The law says that women have equal rights to property.

01:20.672 --> 01:23.331
But we all know that here in

01:23.332 --> 01:26.811
the villages, local custom is what matters.

01:26.812 --> 01:28.939
We cannot force the traditional

01:28.940 --> 01:30.947
leaders to change their minds.

01:30.948 --> 01:34.163
Perhaps a more effective way would be to use

01:34.166 --> 01:37.862
the custom and religious norms in our favor.

01:37.863 --> 01:39.043
How so?

01:39.044 --> 01:43.011
Well, for example, traditional custom says that it is

01:43.012 --> 01:46.091
the responsibility of the women to look after the

01:46.092 --> 01:49.091
feminist children with the help of her community.

01:49.092 --> 01:52.819
But most of the displaced widows have children.

01:52.820 --> 01:54.987
We can argue that in order to look

01:54.988 --> 01:57.747
after their children, the women must have access

01:57.748 --> 01:59.939
to their house and to their land.

01:59.940 --> 02:01.435
That makes sense.

02:01.436 --> 02:03.627
I think that's a good strategy.

02:03.628 --> 02:06.907
We should also remember that local practices may

02:06.908 --> 02:09.523
not always align with these norms, and we

02:09.533 --> 02:11.033
need to work to change that.

02:11.034 --> 02:12.666
I agree.

02:12.667 --> 02:14.627
We need to be strategic in our approach

02:14.628 --> 02:17.131
and consider all the factors at play.

02:17.132 --> 02:19.829
Our ultimate goal is to advocate for the rights of

02:19.830 --> 02:23.325
the widows and ensure they can return to their properties.

02:23.326 --> 02:25.901
I think we have a solid plan of action.

02:25.902 --> 02:27.461
Let's set a date for the next

02:27.462 --> 02:30.685
meeting where we can finalize the details.

02:30.686 --> 02:31.989
Sounds good.

02:31.990 --> 02:34.525
Agreed. Great. Let's make it happen.
